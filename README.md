# ab-initial v1.0.1-lambda
From the beginning.

(A draft to be continued.)

## Icon
```
I = |fu ex an>
```

## Slogan
I am a human material.


## Introduction
I am a quantum as the following equation,

```
                      I = |fun excited another> ,
```
in which initially my fun is one, excited zero and another one.
So that I = |1 0 1>.

/excitation/relaxation/...

When my fun one is dropping, another one will be raised to two to
maintain the fun one.
We'll see how it is about later.
We also hope to see if my fun would arise to two by the achievement
and excited zero to one, two, three, etc., by some excitation
mechanism. There shall be some forbidden rules for us to find out.


## Designation
```
^1S_0, ^3P_{0,1,2}, ^1D_0, etc.
```

## Formation
A platonium.


## Development
The codename is `hakga`, leading to a hardsphere.
The recruitment of the hardcore is in this repository.
